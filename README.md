EducationForAll is a student-led platform created to empower Priory students to learn, teach, and grow together. At its core, the site allows students to support one another by sharing review videos specifically tailored to our school’s curriculum. Whether it's explaining a math problem, analyzing a reading, or breaking down a science concept, students can upload their YouTube links, categorize them by class, and include titles and descriptions—making the content easy to find and aligned with what’s taught in class.

The platform includes a searchable video library, a discovery page to browse new or popular uploads, and a course-based structure to ensure relevance. Each hour-long video also earns the contributor two hours of school service credit. Most importantly, you're learning from classmates who understand your assignments, your teachers, and your school. EducationForAll.com makes studying more relatable, collaborative, and meaningful.
