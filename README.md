# EducationForAll
## Description  
EducationForAll is a student-led platform created to empower Priory students to learn, teach, and grow together. At its core, the site allows students to support one another by sharing review videos specifically tailored to our school’s curriculum. Whether it's explaining a math problem, analyzing a reading, or breaking down a science concept, students can upload their YouTube links, categorize them by class, and include titles and descriptions—making the content easy to find and aligned with what’s taught in class.

The platform includes a searchable video library, a discovery page to browse new or popular uploads, and a course-based structure to ensure relevance. Each hour-long video also earns the contributor two hours of school service credit. Most importantly, you're learning from classmates who understand your assignments, your teachers, and your school. EducationForAll.com makes studying more relatable, collaborative, and meaningful.  

## Later additions
In future versions, before students can register, the school partnering with us will provide each student with a unique invitation code. When students sign up using this code, they will gain access to the EducationForAll.com platform specific to their school. For example, both Menlo and Priory students will log in through the same website, but because they use different codes during registration, the system will automatically direct them to their respective school pages. This approach allows us to scale the platform beyond Priory while keeping content organized and school-specific. Ethan Zhang, once we have tested this concept in Priory, you can email other schools and sell this idea to them.
